Please make sure that :
1. Within the directory that the files 'VOXSPELL.jar' and 'runMe.sh' (without quotation marks) is in, there
	is a file named 'NZCER-spelling-lists.txt' (again, without quotation marks) within that same directory.
	If one does not exist, please create one or get one from somewhere as you cannot attempt as quiz without
	this file present
2. Within the directory that the files 'VOXSPELL.jar' and 'runMe.sh' (without quotation marks) is in, there
	is a file named 'big_buck_bunny_1_minute.avi' (you guessed it, without the quotation marks) within the
	same directory. If one does not exist, please make sure one exists to enable any video reward at the end
	of a quiz
3. Festival is downloaded and installed as well as have the following voices installed:
	(voice_kal_diphone)
	(voice_akl_nz_jdt_diphone)
4. Java Version 1.8 is installed at the following directory:
	/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8/
   A script file is included which you will need to execute in order to run the application

To run the application, run the runMe.sh file. At the command line (with the current directory being the one where 
runMe.sh is in), execute the following:
	
	./runMe.sh

This will run VOXSPELL

Enjoy!
