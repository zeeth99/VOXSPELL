So far the main work has gone into refactoring the code from assignment 2. Ray has started working on the new version of the stats page while I have been seperating the different screens into different classes. This refactoring should make it easier for us to work on the project at the same time. This is because merging work from two people on the same file is more difficult than if they are working on diffreent files. 
The new stats screen will have tabs for the statistics of each level, making the statistics more visually accessible.

Working on implementing and fixing a SwingWorker class which handles text to speech so that the GUI is responsive while it reads out
the word to spell.

Added level progression to the quiz which allows user to go from one level to the next when they get 9 out of 10 words correct. Still need to add video reward at the end of completing a level as well as decided on whether to 'complete' the quiz before giving the options
of progressing, retrying or the video.
Implemented leveling in Review Mode. A level select for review may be good but for the assignment it was fine to begin at level 1. Lots
of new files added to store words to be reviewed (one for each level).
