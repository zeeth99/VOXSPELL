So far a large portion of my time has gone into refactoring the code from assignment 2. This refactoring has made it easier for us to work on the project at the same time. This is because merging work from two people on the same file is more difficult than if they are working on different files.
Ray is working on making festival proccess in the background. He has completed this and now is looking into rearranging the calls to festival so that festival does not talk over itself. 
The mode select screen is now up and running. This screen allows the user to choose a level to quiz at or select the review quiz type.
Our next tasks are tweaking festival calls, adding level differentiation to the statistics, and giving the option to proceed to the next level after doing well in a quiz.
